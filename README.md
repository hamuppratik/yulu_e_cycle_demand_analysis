Yulu Electric Cycle Demand Analysis:

In this project, I defined and analyzed the problem of declining revenue for Yulu, a leading micro-mobility service provider in India, by focusing on the factors that influence the demand for their shared electric cycles. The primary goals were to identify key variables predicting demand, analyze how these variables explain fluctuations in usage, and provide actionable insights to enhance service utilization and revenue.

Problem Definition:

Objective: Identify key variables that significantly predict demand for shared electric cycles and analyze their influence on usage trends and fluctuations.
Scope: Offer actionable insights to help Yulu optimize service utilization and increase revenue.
Statistical Analysis and Insights:
Bivariate Analysis: Showed no significant difference in bike rentals between working and non-working days.
T-tests: Confirmed that neither working days nor holidays significantly affect rental counts.
Kruskal-Wallis Test: Identified significant differences in cycle rentals across seasons, indicating a strong seasonal component in demand.
Chi-Square Test: Established a dependency between weather conditions and bike rentals, highlighting the impact of environmental factors.

Key Findings:

Temporal Patterns: The data shows a growth trend in electric cycle usage, with a noticeable peak in 2012. Seasonal shifts are evident, with higher bike rentals during the summer months (July-September) and a decline in winter (January-March).
Weather Influence: Favorable weather conditions, such as sunny days, correlate with increased rentals, while adverse weather, like rain or cold, decreases demand. The analysis confirmed that weather significantly impacts bike rental rates.
Usage Consistency Across Days: Weekdays and holidays exhibit similar demand, indicating consistent usage regardless of the day type.
Additional Considerations:
Demographics: Analyzing the impact of demographics (age, income level, occupation) on demand could offer deeper insights.
External Factors: Considering the effects of external factors, such as public transport strikes, local events, or changes in fuel prices, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of demand shifts.
Regional Analysis: Examining demand at different Yulu zones could reveal regional preferences and usage patterns.

Recommendations:

Seasonal Demand Management: Focus on optimizing bike availability during peak seasons and consider strategies to boost usage during lower demand periods, such as winter.
Weather-Responsive Strategies: Implement dynamic pricing or promotions based on weather forecasts to incentivize rentals during unfavorable conditions.
Targeted Marketing: Develop campaigns that cater to different demographics, regions, and usage patterns to increase engagement and utilization.
Consistency in Service Availability: Maintain consistent bike availability across weekdays and holidays to meet steady demand.
